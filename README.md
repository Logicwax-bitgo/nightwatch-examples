# Nightwatch Example Project #

<https://github.com/stinebean3/nightwatch-examples>

## About ##

This is an example repo to help you get started with testing using [Nightwatch.js].

Included is a "test.js" file containing a set of example tests against 
google.com as well as a "Makefile" to set everything up and run the test for you.

In order to create your own Nightwatch project, feel free to "fork" or copy 
these files to get you started and adjust "test.js" to write tests for your
own projects.
